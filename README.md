Exercise for the Lexicon .NET course.

## Things I do not understand

What the differences between the class file created by "New -> File" in the file menu
and the class file created by "Add -> Class" in the context menu of the Solution
Explorer actually do.

Why the IDE permits me to create the repo and the initial commit without configuring
a name and an e-mail address, but requires these things to create additional commits.

Which thing, out of all the confused things I did, it was that got the IDE to tell
me what the problem was, and give me an opportunity to solve it.
